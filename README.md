# NaiveBayes-SupervisedLearning

We make choices everyday and our decisions are based on certain factors. If we can keep records of
what factors we consider and their respective values that we use to make a decision, we observe certain
trends which we may be able to use predict what choice one will make given some values of the factors
considered.

This is a typical supervised learning task which can be achieved computationally by the probabilistic
algorithm known as the Naive Bayes algorithm.

In Ghana at least, this largely depends on ethnicity, level of education, current economic state, occupation, gender, etc.
Thus if we wanted to tell one's political inclination given that he comes from the Volta region, has basic education, fair economic
state, carpenter and male, we have to consider all these factors and this changes the dimension of the
Bayes' formula.

Let us work with this example from a U.S setting. The goal is to predict the political inclination
(conservative or liberal) of a person based on his or her job (analyst, barista, cook, or doctor), sex
(male, female), and annual income (low, medium, high).
